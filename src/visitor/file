no concrete example here

this pattern is applicable when you need to add functionality to a composite of objects.
there must be a way to travers in the composite object.
newly add functionality is implemented in the visitor object, it's centralized
and it's the only place you need to change.
objects in the composite should provide functions to relieve its state for the visitor.
visitor get those states by traversing.
